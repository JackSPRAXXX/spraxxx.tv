# 🌲 SPRAXXX.TV — The Nation Live

**Brotherhood on the air: open mic, truth, and movement.**  
SPRAXXX is not just a platform. It’s a cedar-rooted Nation.  
Where code meets covenant. Where digital meets physical.  
Where God’s word, backyard grit, and neon banners collide.

## 📜 Psalms & Proverbs of the Nation

We write code like David wrote psalms.  
We drop wisdom like cedar proverbs.  

Example:  

```text
Blessed is the one who walks not in phoniness,  
Nor stands with scoffers of brotherhood,  
But delights in the law of the Lord,  
And finds shade in the cedars of SPRAXXX.
